# The Plan

Create 6 games to render on each face of a 3d cube.
These games will target a canvas, and cube will grab its texture and clone it to the face.
Using iframes could be difficult with centering etc, so targeting a canvas gives
use more control.

## Limitations

The games must be contained in a 300x300 canvas.
The games must only need to have a game update, a render, and inputs to function.
Does not start automatically, can be paused.
Each game must follow a retro art style - yet to be defined.

Try to make game classes that can be reused across all games.
etc. The grid system, collision, rendering.
